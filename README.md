# US Layoff Risk Prediction & Workforce Forecasting

This project uses regression-based machine learning to predict the likelihood of layoffs across industries and states. It combines predictive modeling, interactive dashboards, and a Flask-based API to enable proactive workforce decision-making.
---

##Features
- Trains a regression model to predict layoff risk based on industry and unemployment data  
- Includes a Jupyter notebook (`model_training.ipynb`) for data cleaning and model training  
- Sample dataset (`sample_data.csv`) with anonymized input features  
- A Flask API (`app.py`) that returns layoff risk scores for given input  
---

## ðŸ”§ Tech Stack
- Python, Pandas, scikit-learn â€“ Data processing and ML model  
- Flask â€“ API backend for serving predictions  
- Jupyter Notebook â€“ Model training and exploration  
- Power BI â€“ Interactive visualization (dashboard.png optional)  
- Git + GitHub â€“ Version control and project hosting
